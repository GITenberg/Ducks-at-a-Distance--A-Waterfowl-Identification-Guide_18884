<p>Identifying waterfowl gives many hours of enjoyment
to millions of people. This guide will help you
recognize birds on the wing&mdash;it emphasizes their fall
and winter plumage patterns as well as size,
shape, and flight characteristics. It does not include
local names.</p>

<p>Recognizing the species of ducks and geese can be
rewarding to birdwatchers and hunters&mdash;and the ducks.</p>

<p>Hunters can contribute to their own sport by not
firing at those species that are either protected or
scarce, and needed as breeders to restore the flocks.
It can add to their daily limit; when extra birds of
certain species can be taken legally, hunters who
know their ducks on the wing come out ahead.</p>

<p>Knowing a mallard from a merganser has another
side: gourmets prefer a corn-fed mallard to the fish
duck.</p>

<h2><a name="What_to_Look_For" id="What_to_Look_For"></a>What to Look For</h2>


<p>Differences in size, shape, plumage patterns and
colors, wing beat, flocking behavior, voice, and habitat&mdash;all
help to distinguish one species from another.</p>

<p>Flock maneuvers in the air are clues. Mallards, pintails,
and wigeon form loose groups; teal and shovelers
flash by in small, compact bunches; at a distance,
canvasbacks shift from waving lines to temporary V's.</p>

<p>Closer up, individual silhouettes are important.
Variations of head shapes and sizes, lengths of wings
and tails, and fat bodies or slim can be seen.</p>

<p>Within shotgun range, color areas can be important. Light
conditions might make them look different, but their size
and location are positive keys. The sound of their wings can
help as much as their calls. Flying goldeneyes make a
whistling sound; wood ducks move with a swish;
canvasbacks make a steady rushing sound. Not all ducks
quack; many whistle, squeal, or grunt.</p>

<p>Although not a hard and fast rule, different species
tend to use different types of habitat. Puddle ducks
like shallow marshes and creeks while divers prefer
larger, deeper, and more open waters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most ducks shed their body
feathers twice each year.
Nearly all drakes lose their
bright plumage after mating, and for
a few weeks resemble females. This
hen-like appearance is called the
eclipse plumage. The return to
breeding coloration varies
in species and individuals of each
species. Blue-winged teal and shovelers may
retain the eclipse plumage until
well into the winter.</p>



<p>Wing feathers are shed only once
a year; wing colors are always
the same.</p>

<h2><a name="Puddle_Ducks" id="Puddle_Ducks"></a>Puddle Ducks</h2>


<p>Puddle ducks are typically birds of fresh, shallow
marshes and rivers rather than of large lakes and bays.
They are good divers, but usually feed by dabbling
or tipping rather than submerging.</p>

<p>The speculum, or colored wing patch, is generally
iridescent and bright, and often a telltale field mark.</p>

<p>Any duck feeding in croplands will likely be a puddle
duck, for most of this group are sure-footed and can
walk and run well on land. Their diet is mostly
vegetable, and grain-fed mallards or pintails or
acorn-fattened wood ducks are highly regarded
as food.</p>

<p>The mallard is our most common duck, found in all
flyways. The males are often called "greenheads." The
main wintering area is the lower Mississippi basin,
and along the gulf coast, but many stay as far north
as open waters permits.</p>

<p>Flocks often feed in early
morning and late afternoon in
nearby harvested fields,
returning to marshes and
creeks to spend the night.</p>

<p>The flight is not particularly
rapid. Hens have a loud <i>quack</i>;
the drake's voice is a
low-pitched <i>kwek-kwek</i>.</p>

<p>These ducks use all four flyways, but are most
plentiful in the west.</p>

<p>They are extremely graceful and fast fliers, fond of
zig-zagging from great heights before leveling
off to land.</p>

<p>The long neck and tail make them appear longer
than mallards, but in body size and weight
they are smaller.</p>

<p>Gadwalls are most numerous in the Central Flyway,
but not too common anywhere. They are often called
"gray mallards" or "gray ducks." They are one of the
earliest migrants, seldom facing cold weather.</p>

<p>They are the only puddle ducks with a white
speculum.</p>

<p>These are nervous birds, quick to take alarm. Their
flight is fast, irregular, with many twists and turns. In
a bunched flock, their movements have been
compared to those of pigeons.</p>

<p>When open water is handy, wigeons often
raft up offshore until late afternoon when they
move to marshes and ponds to feed.</p>

<p>Shovelers, 'spoonbills' to many, are early migrants, moving

<p>Their small size and twisting
turning flight gives the
illusion of great speed. The
small, compact flocks
commonly fly low over the
marshes, and often take the
hunter by surprise.</p>

<p>They are more vocal than most
ducks&mdash;their high-pitched
peeping and nasal quacking is
commonly heard in spring and
to a lesser extent in fall.</p>

<p>These teal are among the first
ducks to migrate each fall, and
one of the last in the spring.</p>

<h2><a name="Diving_Ducks" id="Diving_Ducks"></a>Diving Ducks</h2>


<p>Diving ducks frequent the larger, deeper lakes and
rivers, and coastal bays and inlets.</p>

<p>The colored wing patches of these birds lack the
brilliance of the speculums of puddle ducks. Since
many of them have short tails, their huge, paddle feet
may be used as rudders in flight, and are often
visible on flying birds. When launching into flight,
most of this group patter along the water before
becoming airborne.</p>

<p>They feed by diving, often to considerable depths. To
escape danger, they can travel great distances
underwater, emerging only enough to show their
head before submerging again.</p>

<p>Their diets of fish, shellfish, mollusks, and aquatic
plants make them second choice, as a group, for
sportsmen. Canvasbacks and redheads fattened on
eel grass or wild celery are notable exceptions.</p>

<p>Since their wings are smaller in proportion to the size
and weight of their bodies, they have a more rapid
wingbeat than puddle ducks.</p>

<p>Waterfowl Flyways</p>

<p>The term "flyway" has long been
used to designate the migration routes of
birds. For management purposes, four
waterfowl flyways&mdash;Pacific, Central,
Mississippi, and Atlantic&mdash;were established in the
United States in 1948. To varying degrees the
waterfowl populations using each of these flyways
differ in abundance, species composition, migration
pathways, and breeding ground origin. There are
differences, also, in levels of shooting pressure and
harvest.</p>

<p>For the most part flyway boundaries follow State lines.
However, the boundary between the Pacific and the
Central flyway general follows the Continental Divide.</p>

<p>There are some problems in matching waterfowl
migration corridors with flyway boundaries because
some species nest and winter in areas that do not
occur along a north-south axis. These species cross
flyway boundaries during migration. On balance, the
present arrangement is useful in that it permits
reasonable management of waterfowl. At some future
time, it is possible that further rearrangement of
boundaries may permit better management of the
waterfowl resource.</p>


<p>Flyway Councils</p>

<p>In 1952, Flyway Councils were formed in each of the
four flyways. The Council in each flyway is made up
of representatives from the wildlife agencies of the
States in that flyway&mdash;one representative from each
State. The Councils study flyway problems, develop
waterfowl management recommendations, and
generally work closely with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in implementing waterfowl
management and research programs.</p>

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
